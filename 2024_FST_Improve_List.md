- [ ] Add CAN communication support with ECU
- [ ] Battery CV/CC charging stragety is a crap, make is more complete
- [ ] Temperature sensors are not at the hot spot, make them be in the next design
- [ ] Try any solution to log the data of battery during driving test
- [ ] Check ESD protection level of the PCB, re-design if necessary
