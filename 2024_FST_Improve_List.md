# Improve suggestion list
- [ ] Fix manual discharge suspension during regular loop
- [ ] Add CAN communication support with ECU
- [ ] Battery CV/CC charging stragety is a crap, make is more complete (need to add current sensor in order to monitor CV stage)
- [ ] Temperature sensors are not at the hot spot, make them be in the next design
- [ ] Try any solution to log the data of battery during driving test
- [ ] Check ESD protection level of the PCB, re-design if necessary
